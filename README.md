### Built with

- [Ionic v5](https://ionicframework.com/docs) - Ionic Framework is the open-source mobile app development framework that makes it easy to build top quality native and progressive web apps with web technologies. 
- [Angular v11](https://angular.io/) - Angular is a TypeScript-based free and open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.
